            <!-- <ul><b>Type of Output: </b>Web application (Angular frontend, Flask backend)</ul> -->

            <ul><b>Project Overview:</b> This project aimed to create a tool that facilitates the documentation and analysis of the provenance of art and cultural assets,
            particularly those looted during the Nazi era. The primary focus was developing a standardized data schema to ensure consistent data entry, 
            verification, and the linking of historical records. 
            This allowed researchers to work with a reliable and accurate tool that simplified the process of tracing and documenting the history 
            of ownership of objects. The tool is integrated into the larger Data Management System but is designed to function as a standalone 
            component as well, offering flexibility in how it can be deployed depending on the needs of the user. </ul>
